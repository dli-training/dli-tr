title: Curating Data Sets for Reproducibility
---

This workshop will cover key considerations for preparing and sharing data and software to improve the reproducibility of published results. Participants will have the opportunity to put into practice lessons learned while exploring published data sets. Openly available tools that support reproducibility will also be examined.

2. Compile the following dataset materials in OSF:
   - Balanced Journalism Amplifies Minority Positions: A Case Study of the Newspaper Coverage of a Fluoridation Plebiscite (Kiss et al., 2018)  
     - Article: <https://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/3355>  
     - Repo (data & code): <https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP/V2VPZ4>
   - The state of OA: a large-scale analysis of the prevalence and impact of Open Access articles (Piwowar et al., 2018)  
     - Article: <https://peerj.com/articles/4375/>  
     - Repo (data): <https://zenodo.org/record/1041791#.XXAIisR7m70>  
     - Repo (code): <https://github.com/Impactstory/oadoi-paper1>
   - A review of riverine ecosystem service quantification: research gaps and recommendations (Hanna et al., 2017)  
     - Article: <https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13045>  
     - Repo (data & code): <https://zenodo.org/record/1013254>
3. Complete [Activity 2: Reproducibility Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0c5-DDVo2MMoF2rPOiH2brIZyC_3YZZrcgp0x6VCPs/edit).

### Part III: Reproducibility from the perspective of data re-users

1. Open the following link:
   - Is there a relationship between countries’ wealth or spending on schooling and its students’ performance in PISA? (Klajnerok, 2017)
     - Article: <https://towardsdatascience.com/is-there-a-relationship-between-countries-wealth-or-spending-on-schooling-and-its-students-a9feb669be8c>  
2. Open [Activity 3: Exploring the repository and the notebook](/activity3/).
3. Open [Activity 4: Experimenting with the code](/activity4/).
4. Bonus activity: Play around with another repository:
    - How significant are the public dimensions of faculty work in review, promotion, and tenure documents? (Alperin et al., 2018)
      - Article: <http://doi.org/10.17613/M6W950N3>
      - Reproduced Repo (data & code): <https://github.com/research-reuse/rpt-project>  
        - What are the differences between this project and the last one?
