### <a id="abstract"></a>Conference Abstract

The Data Liberation Initiative (DLI) is a partnership between Canada's national statistics agency and data librarians and specialists representing universities and colleges across the country. The program was established in 1996 in order to increase access to microdata for teaching and research purposes. In the early 2000s, DLI-affiliated librarians created a repository to provide access to training materials created by and for the data community as a means of supporting knowledge transfer and dissemination.

The repository has moved twice already in its 20-year lifespan, but it now needs to be moved again. Best practices in metadata for discovery have changed dramatically over the last few decades, something that is readily apparent when searching the collection. A large number of 'maintainers' and a lack of controlled vocabulary meant that digital materials were deposited and described inconsistently over time, leading to challenges for end-users in the navigation and retrieval of relevant items.

After consultation with the DLI data community, it was determined that there was a desire not only for improved description, but for curated learning trajectories designed to support independent learning and development of data literacy skills. As a result, a working group was formed to evaluate new platform solutions and identify opportunities to improve descriptive metadata and file formats of the training materials.

In this presentation, we will show how we applied FAIR principles to make the training materials easier to find, (re)use, and adapt, not only for the benefit of our data community but for everyone. The DLI Training Repository is not just a complex collection of learning objects; it's a historical archive capturing the evolving trends in the development of the DLI data community in Canada.
